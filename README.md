# What is this?

I hate the German keyboard layout on Macs because I often have to do finger ballet for certain special characters frequently used for programming. Therefore, I prefer English keyboard layouts to German one.

I have a MacBook Pro with EN-UK keyboard layout for work. My custom keyboard layout has sane placements of special characters while still allows me to write German special characters, i.e. the Umlauts and the sz (ß).

- option + a = ä
- option + shift + a = Ä
- option + u = ü
- option + shift + u = Ü
- option + o = ö
- option + shift + o = Ö
- option + s = ß

## Installation
1. Copy the bundle file to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`
2. Go to `System Preferences->Keyboard->Input Sources`. Click on the `+` icon on the bottom left, and select your custom layout from the list in the sidebar
3. Click on the Input Sources icon on the menubar, and select your layout. Now, whenever you press the keys that you changed, it will perform the functions that you mapped to it, instead of the default functions. 

## Modifying
The keylayout file can be modified with Ukulele (https://software.sil.org/ukelele/).

## TODOs
- Euro symbol instead of British Poundsterling mapped to option + 3.
